Step1: verify current port of http
[root@rhelnode1 selinux]# grep -i listen /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  | grep -v '#'
Listen 80
[root@rhelnode1 selinux]#

Step2: Modify the port of http from 80 to 888
[root@rhelnode1 selinux]# grep -i listen /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  | grep -v '#'
Listen 888
[root@rhelnode1 selinux]#

Step3: make sure enforecing mode as "enforcing" and it should not be permisive/ disable
[root@rhelnode1 selinux]# getenforce
Enforcing
[root@rhelnode1 selinux]#

Step4: Now verify http service responding or not
[root@rhelnode1 selinux]# systemctl restart httpd
Job for httpd.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
See "systemctl status httpd.service" and "journalctl -xeu httpd.service" for details.

[root@rhelnode1 selinux]#


Step5:  SElinux given set of ports only allowed and 888 is not part of below.
[root@rhelnode1 selinux]# semanage port -l | grep ^http_port_t
http_port_t                    tcp      80, 81, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443, 9000
[root@rhelnode1 selinux]

Step6: Now lets add 888 also to list
[root@rhelnode1 selinux]# semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 888

[root@rhelnode1 selinux]# systemctl restart httpd
